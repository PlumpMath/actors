/**
 * An {@link AddressTransformer} that takes the last element out of a remote address and uses it as the link identifier (and vice-versa), as
 * well as handles conversion of the local address.
 * <p>
 * This class relies on 3 properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>remoteAddressBase - prefix of remote addresses</li>
 * <li>selfAddress - address of owning actor</li>
 * <li>selfLinkId - link id of owning actor</li>
 * </ul>
 * How {@link #toLinkId(com.offbynull.peernetic.core.shuttle.Address) } works...
 * <p>
 * When using {@link #toLinkId(com.offbynull.peernetic.core.shuttle.Address) } with a remote address (an address with the prefix
 * {@code remoteAddressBase}, it will return the next address element after the prefix. Note that this means any additional suffix won't
 * be retained when the conversion takes place. For example, if {@code remoteAddressBase=actor_system_0:nodes}, and the address being
 * converted is {@code actor_system_0:nodes:node_1:sub1:msg1}, the link id will be {@code node_1}.
 * <p>
 * When using {@link #toLinkId(com.offbynull.peernetic.core.shuttle.Address) } with your local address (an address with the prefix
 * {@code selfAddress}, it will return {@code selfId}. Note that just like with remote addresses, any additional suffix won't  be retained
 * when the conversion takes place.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * How {@link #toAddress(java.lang.String) } works...
 * <p>
 * When using {@link #toAddress(java.lang.String) }, if the link id is {@code selfLinkId} then {@code selfAddress} will be returned.
 * Otherwise, the returned address will be the link id appended on to {@code remoteAddressBase}.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable.
