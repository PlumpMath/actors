# Peernetic

Peernetic is a Java actor-based P2P computing framework specifically designed to facilitate development and testing of distributed and P2P algorithms. Peernetic provides high-level features to visualize overlays, run large-scale simulations, and simulate dynamic network conditions (e.g. MTU, packet loss, packet duplication, latency, jitter, etc).
