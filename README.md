# Peernetic

The Peernetic project is a lightweight Java actor framework.

Why use Peernetic over other generic actor frameworks like Akka or Orbit? While Peernetic can be used as a generic actor framework, it was designed first and foremost with the development of P2P/distributed software in mind. That is to say, Peernetic provides a feature-set that takes some of the pain out of P2P/distributed software development. Peernetic's high-level features include:

* Visualization of network overlays
* Actor simulation environment
* Simulation of network conditions (e.g. packet loss/duplication, latency, jitter, etc..)

More information on the topic of actors and their advantages can be found on the following pages:
