 * A {@link PcpOption} that doesn't map to any of the known PCP option values presented in the RFC. From the RFC:
 * <pre>
 *    Because the PCP client cannot reject a response containing an Option,
 *    PCP clients MUST ignore Options that they do not understand that
 *    appear in responses, including Options in the mandatory-to-process
 *    range.  Naturally, if a client explicitly requests an Option where
 *    correct execution of that Option requires processing the Option data
 *    in the response, that client SHOULD implement code to do that.
